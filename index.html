        I attend the State College Ruby Group regularly, and have been since October of 2008. In late 2010 I became the primary presenter there. I have given a series of talks on subjects like &ldquo;New Elements in HTML5 and CSS3,&rdquo; &ldquo;EventMachine,&rdquo; &ldquo;ActiveRecord Basics,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beginning Node.JS,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beginning CoffeeScript,&rdquo; and &ldquo;How to use Pry.&rdquo;

        I've also been developing a hackerspace in State College for several years, and in August 2011 joined forces with <a href="http://innoblue.org">Innoblue</a> to create the &ldquo;Innoblue Garage&rdquo;. At this space, I've begun doing some basic tutoring sessions in learning how to program with Ruby. I've also consulted several local startups on how to develop an application, effective UX design, software estimation, and object-oriented design.
      </p>
      <p>
        During college and shortly afterwards, I've done a variety of graphic and web designs for local businesses and non-profit organizations. This includes a newspaper flyer advertising sales for a muzzleloader supply store, a menu for a local diner, websites for student organizations, and wall flyers for student-run events. My clients continue to count on me to deliver consistent results, and I'm very opinionated on effective campaigns as a result.

      <p class="courses">
        I started my college career as a computer science major and honor student, with classes like Programming 101 and Assembly. I felt that what I was learning was much easier than what I had been building in my free time, and didn't mesh well with my desire to become a web developer. I loved helping other students with their sotware projects, but by the end of the year I switched majors.

      <div class="courses">
        <p>
          I went from being in the Sciences to being in the Liberal Arts. In Lock Haven's &ldquo;GOLD&rdquo; program, I developed an appreciation of basic design principles and typography. The most valuable thing I took away from this program was a very serious eye towards our own design work.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each assignment (like magazine articles or logos), we were given a few days to work on each piece. But &ldquo;turning in&rdquo; your work involved standing at the front of the class, presenting your piece, and standing nearby while your classmates ruthlessly tore into your design. You would hear that your piece was ineffective at its goals, or that you didn't use space efficiently, or that it &ldquo;just plain sucked&rdquo;. It was an incredibly humbling experience, and gave me a fantastic appreciation of the amount of work it took to make something effective. I wouldn't trade those experiences for any other experience in the world.
