    <h1>My Story.</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span12">

      <h2>I have been programming my entire life.</h2>

      <p>It started when my parents bought me and my brothers our first computer. At the time, it was a top-of-the-line PC: 386 processor, Sound Blaster, SVGA graphics, a 300 megabyte hard drive, and a CD-ROM drive!</p>

      <p>Our games consisted primarily of random shareware disks that we bought at the mall or received through the mail. We were swimming in games, but many of them wouldn't run until we figured out how to tweak the XMS and EMS settings in order to have enough memory.</p>

      <h2>Exposition</h2>

      <p>One day, I found a top-down shooter game tucked away in an &ldquo;Other&rdquo; folder on one of these shareware disks. When I ran it in MS-DOS, the various startup screens looked amazing. But attempting to move past the menu caused the usual variety of memory problems, and the game would dump me out on the command line.</p>

      <p><strong>No amount of memory tweaking would let me in.</strong> I tried messing with every single preference the game made available, but nothing would actually let me play. And then I had an idea; could I force the game to work with the amount of memory that I had?</p>

      <p>I remembered browsing the files in various other games, and discovering that different programs stored their resources (like music, images, and libraries) in different ways, and if I could figure out what the extension meant, I could open them up in other programs. I could look at the images in Microsoft Paint, draw different things on them, and see my changes in the game.</p>

      <p>So whilst staring at the files listed in the game's folder, I saw how large some of the image files were. One of them was an image that contained all of the animation sprites for one of the enemies. It took up only a few kilobytes, but it was enough to make up for the lack of memory for my computer. I deleted the file&#8230; <em>and the game ran!</em> I can't describe the elation I felt when I got something running for the first time through unconventional means.</p>

      <p>I continued to mess with the resource files in many other games throughout my childhood. My tweaking hit a high point when I learned how to hex-edit a savegame for &ldquo;Might &amp; Magic III: Isles of Terra.&rdquo;That game gave me several characters with 20-30 numbered characteristics to build upon, much like any other AD&amp;D-based role playing game. Opening up the savegame with the hexeditor gave me a mass of unreadable symbols, but stepping through page by page, I could find my characters' names in plain English. Then I could convert the various attributes that your character has into their base-16 equivalents, and search for those variables underneath the plain text. Find and change the right one, and now my 1st-level character is comparable to one at the 60th.</p>

      <p>I was hooked, but I was also continuously frustrated by the lack of modifiable resources available to me. Not everything could be touched or changed; I was constrained by the logic of the actual programming that the game's developers created. I couldn't settle for tweaking any more. I wanted to build.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>

      <p>I discovered that the family computer had a copy of QBasic on it. QBasic

        I started attending the State College Ruby Group since October of 2008.
        After being hired by West Arete, in late 2010 I was the primary presenter. I gave a series of talks on subjects like "New Elements in HTML5 and CSS3", "EventMachine", "ActiveRecord Basics", "Beginning Node.JS", "Beginning CoffeeScript", and "How to use Pry".
      </p>
      <p class="completed">
        I've also been working on creating a hackerspace in State College for several years, and in August 2011 joined forces with <a href="http://innoblue.org">Innoblue</a> to create the "Innoblue Garage". At this space, I've begun doing some basic tutoring sessions in learning how to program with Ruby. I've also consulted several local startups on how to develop an application, effective UX design, software estimation, and object-oriented design.
      </p>
      <p>
        During college and shortly afterwards, I've done a variety of graphic and web designs for local businesses and non-profit organizations. This includes a newspaper flyer advertising sales for a muzzleloader supply store, a menu for a local diner, websites for student organizations, and wall flyers for student-run events. My friends continue to count on me to deliver consistent results, and I'm very opinionated on effective campaigns as a result.

        I started my college career as a computer science major and honor student, with classes like Programming 101 and Assembly. I felt that what I was learning was much easier than what I had been building in my free time, and didn't mesh well with my desire to become a web developer. I loved helping other students with their sotware projects, but by the end of the year I switched majors.

          I went from being in the Sciences to being in the Liberal Arts. In Lock Haven's "GOLD" program, I developed an appreciation of basic design principles and typography. The most valuable thing I took away from this program was a very serious eye towards our own design work.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each assignment (like magazine articles or logos), we were given a few days to work on each piece. But "turning in" your work involved standing at the front of the class, presenting your piece, and standing nearby while your classmates ruthlessly tore into your design. You would hear that your piece was ineffective at its goals, or that you didn't use space efficiently, or that it "just plain sucked". It was an incredibly humbling experience, and gave me a fantastic appreciation of the amount of work it took to make something effective. I wouldn't trade those experiences for any other experience in the world.
